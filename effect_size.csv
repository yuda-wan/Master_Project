Effects of sown wildflower fields on the common hamster (cricetus cricetus) at local and landscape scales","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.021","During the last decades, agriculture has been rapidly intensified, resulting in a strong decline in species diversity.
Therefore the common agricultural policy (CAP) of the EU implemented agri-environmental schemes (AES) for
an environmentally-friendly management of agricultural areas. Sown wildflower fields are one of these measures
aimed at enhancing insect diversity and related ecosystem services. However, little is known about the impacts of
AES on rare and non-target species. To study the effect of these AES on a non-target species, the occurrence of the
endangered common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) was mapped by counting reopened winter burrows on paired
sown wildflower fields and agricultural fields in North-West Bavaria, Germany. Concentration effects in sown
wildflower fields and the distribution of C. cricetus in adjacent agricultural fields were studied by mapping bur-
rows up to a distance of 200 m from sown wildflower and agricultural fields. Furthermore, C. cricetus occurrence
in relation to local (vegetation density, cover of grasses, vegetation height, size of wildflower fields) and
landscape scale parameters (percentage of arable land, grassland, fallow land, distance to the nearest forest,
and settlement) of sown wildflower fields was analysed. Results show that there was a concentration of
C. cricetus in sown wildflower fields, while densities in adjacent agricultural fields were constantly low. Hamster
occurrence was negatively related to vegetation density and grass cover on sown wildflower fields and positively
related to distance to the nearest forests, percentage of arable land and fallow land around wildflower fields. In
conclusion, we could show that sown wildflower fields can be an ideal habitat for non-target species, such as
the common hamster. However, local and landscape scale parameters of sown wildflower fields need to be
considered when designing AES.","mammals","common hamster","Cricetus cricetus","species","adults","natural enemies","transect","Reopened winter burrows were mapped between 21.05. and 20.06.2013 in wildflower and agricultural fields.

at three different study sites in Germany. Natural enemies were sampled annually
in nine sampling rounds at a 10-­ day rhythm using sweep netting and pitfall traps.
To assess available floral resources, we estimated the species-­ specific flower

Treatment effects on arthropod activity density were most pronounced in the
second and third year. Overall, perennial were more attractive than annual flower
strip mixtures for most natural enemies, however, the response to flower strip
mixtures varied significantly among taxa. For example, perennial flower strips
showed a two-­ to fourfold increase of plant-­ dwelling spider and parasitoid wasp

and rove beetles compared to annual flower strips. In contrast, annual flower strip

2. In a 3-­ year field study, two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures, as well
as a grass mixture, were tested regarding their attractiveness for natural enemies
at three different study sites in Germany. Natural enemies were sampled annually
in nine sampling rounds at a 10-­ day rhythm using sweep netting and pitfall traps.
To assess available floral resources, we estimated the species-­ specific flower
cover and classified species into flower types.
3. Flower strip mixtures differed in their attractiveness to natural enemies.
Treatment effects on arthropod activity density were most pronounced in the
second and third year. Overall, perennial were more attractive than annual flower
strip mixtures for most natural enemies, however, the response to flower strip
mixtures varied significantly among taxa. For example, perennial flower strips
showed a two-­ to fourfold increase of plant-­ dwelling spider and parasitoid wasp
activity density as well as higher numbers of juvenile stages of predatory bugs
and rove beetles compared to annual flower strips. In contrast, annual flower strip
mixtures showed the highest attractiveness for ground beetles. Moreover, differ-
ent natural enemy taxa were associated with varying flower strip characteristics
such as flower type proportion, herbivore availability and plant species richness.
4. Synthesis and applications. We found taxon-­ specific responses of natural enemies
to different flower strips, which provide guidance for the floral composition of
flower strips in order to maximize their effectiveness for natural pest control.
We suggest the use of perennial mixtures with high proportion of flower heads
(Asteraceae) and disk flowers (esp. Apiaceae, Rubiaceae, Brassicaceae) in par-

tended to be higher in wildflower areas than in any other
habitat type. Barn Owls, however, preferred to forage in
cereal fields and grassland. They avoided all types of crops
other than cereals, as well as wildflower areas, which
suggests that they do not select their hunting habitat pri-
marily with respect to prey density. Instead of prey abun-
dance, prey accessibility may play a more crucial role:
wildflower areas have a dense vegetation cover, which may
impede access to prey for foraging owls. The exploitation
of wildflower areas by the owls might be enhanced by
creating open foraging corridors within or around wild-
flower areas. Wildflower areas managed in that way might
contribute to restore functional links in food webs within

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased.

To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased.

The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring.

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased.

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

We assessed the effectiveness of these flower field types in providing bumblebee foraging habitat compared to control cereal fields. We sampled bumblebees with transect walks and assessed the richness of exploited pollen plants using DNA meta-barcoding and direct observations. All flower field types enhanced bumblebee abundance and species richness compared to control fields but attracted mostly three generalist species. Although we expected highest benefits from the more heterogeneous mixed flower fields, abundance was highest in annual, only intermediate in mixed, and lowest in perennial flower fields. Bumblebee species richness did not differ between flower field types. Overall, the proportion of sown plants in pollen loads was surprisingly low (< 50%).

Plant species richness in pollen loads decreased with local flowering plant species richness and increased with proportion of annual crops in the landscape, potentially due to the exploitation of more diverse and scattered resources, including flowering crops, in homogenized landscapes to fulfil dietary requirements.

Little knowledge exists, however, about the drivers of wild bee occurrence and if Red List species also profit from this agri-environmental scheme (AES). Therefore, we studied wild bees on transects along 20 four-to five-year-old WFS and in 10 cereal fields without AES (CONTROL sites) in differently structured landscapes across Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). In addition to local site parameters, we measured parameters of landscape structure in a 1 km radius of the WFS and CONTROL sites. The overall species richness of wild bees (125 species in total, 23 on average), including numerous specialist and Red List species, indicates a high attractiveness of perennial WFS sown with 30 native forbs. In CONTROL fields, 11 bee species (on average only one) were found. The species richness and abundance of wild bees were positively affected by local site conditions of the WFS and CONTROL sites, such as the overall number of sown and spontaneous forbs, the amount of flower rewards of sown forbs available to pollinators (Pollinator Feeding Index), and negatively by the cover of grasses. Therefore, seed mixtures of future AES should comprise a high diversity of wildflower species relevant as pollen sources for wild bees. The share of Red List wild bee species was strongly influenced by the landscape context and increased e.g. with Shannon landscape diversity and the availability of non-forest woody habitats and water bodies in the 1 km surroundings. These results suggest that besides the establishment of high-diversity WFS, semi-natural habitat structures have to be promoted to preserve rare wild bees especially in structurally simple agricultural landscapes.

Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers. 3. We observed higher bee richness and increased abundance of smaller sized bees as the size of surrounding greenspace patches increased within a 1,500 m radius landscape buffer. Within habitats, seeded treatments had no effect on bees but greater plant biomass and shorter vegetation were correlated with increased bee richness and abundance. Plant-pollinator interaction networks were dominated by spontaneous non-native vegetation, illustrating that this forage supports urban bees. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that proximity to larger greenspaces within an urban landscape promotes overall bee richness and increased occurrence of smaller bee species within residential vacant lots. While we did not observe our seeded native plants enhancing the bee community, native wildflowers were still establishing during the study and may have a greater influence when blooming at higher densities. Importantly, spontaneous non-native vegetation provided the majority of urban bee's forage. Thus, vacant land that is minimally managed and vegetated with what many consider undesirable 'weeds' provides valuable habitat for bee conservation in cities.","bees","bees","Apoidea","Superfamily","adults","pollinators","trapping","7 yellow pan traps per plot; sampled early/middle/late season (10:0014:00, dry days). 2015: Flowering Lawn, Low Diversity Prairie; 2016: Flowering Lawn, Low Diversity Prairie, High Diversity Prairie.","Green_habitat","Increase_flowers","Wildflower areas","(1)Flowering Lawn: low growing, non-native fine-fescue grasses with four non-native forbs","green - low diversity","lawn","Control: non-native turf grasses and spontaneous vegetation, mown monthly","urban managed lawn","abundance","capture/visitation rate","individuals/7 traps","mean","standard error",20.5,4.964157244,NA,NA,8,"8",7,"traps",13.875,4.210690052,NA,NA,8,"8",7,"traps",NA,"Collected_Bees_(raw_data_pan_traps).xlsx provided via the Data Accessibility link.","360","Individual plot(30 m___12 m)","small (2)","1",NA,"directly applicable","raw","Randomised control trial (2)","experimental","peer-reviewed","Cleveland, Ohio","United States","continental (D)",NA,NA,"other","urban",NA,"moderate (2)",0.3,0.144,20.5,13.875,0.390336226511864,0.0188418153049807

To inform urban bee conservation, we assessed local- and landscape-scale drivers of bee community composition and foraging within vacant lots of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Cleveland is a shrinking city, a type of urban area that has an over-abundance of vacated greenspaces as a result of population loss and subsequent demolition of abandoned infrastructure. As such, Cleveland represents over 350 post-industrial cities worldwide that are all promising locations for bee conservation. 2. Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers. 3.

Cleveland is a shrinking city, a type of urban area that has an over-abundance of vacated greenspaces as a result of population loss and subsequent demolition of abandoned infrastructure. As such, Cleveland represents over 350 post-industrial cities worldwide that are all promising locations for bee conservation. 2. Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers. 3. We observed higher bee richness and increased abundance of smaller sized bees as the size of surrounding greenspace patches increased within a 1,500 m radius landscape buffer. Within habitats, seeded treatments had no effect on bees but greater plant biomass and shorter vegetation were correlated with increased bee richness and abundance. Plant-pollinator interaction networks were dominated by spontaneous non-native vegetation, illustrating that this forage supports urban bees. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that proximity to larger greenspaces within an urban landscape promotes overall bee richness and increased occurrence of smaller bee species within residential vacant lots. While we did not observe our seeded native plants enhancing the bee community, native wildflowers were still establishing during the study and may have a greater influence when blooming at higher densities. Importantly, spontaneous non-native vegetation provided the majority of urban bee's forage. Thus, vacant land that is minimally managed and vegetated with what many consider undesirable 'weeds' provides valuable habitat for bee conservation in cities.","bees","bees","Apoidea","Superfamily","adults","pollinators","trapping","7 yellow pan traps per plot; sampled early/middle/late season (10:0014:00, dry days). 2015: Flowering Lawn, Low Diversity Prairie; 2016: Flowering Lawn, Low Diversity Prairie, High Diversity Prairie.","Green_habitat","Increase_flowers","Wildflower areas","(1)Flowering Lawn: low growing, non-native fine-fescue grasses with four non-native forbs","green - low diversity","lawn","Control: non-native turf grasses and spontaneous vegetation, mown monthly","urban managed lawn","richness","species richness","species/7 traps","mean","standard error",4.625,1.238338461,NA,NA,8,"8",7,"traps",4.375,0.777760062,NA,NA,8,"8",7,"traps",NA,"Collected_Bees_(raw_data_pan_traps).xlsx provided via the Data Accessibility link.","360","Individual plot(30 m___12 m)","small (2)","13",NA,"directly applicable","raw","Randomised control trial (2)","experimental","peer-reviewed","Cleveland, Ohio","United States","continental (D)",NA,NA,"other","urban",NA,"moderate (2)",0.35522260245,0.128431163,4.625,4.375,0.0555698511548108,0.0129116185813037

To test the effectiveness of small-scale floral additions on enhancing urban bee populations, as well as their impact from 1 year to the next, different quantities of potted sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima) flowers were placed across sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan for two consecutive years and the resulting Halictid bee visitors were monitored. Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee abundance and species density in an urban landscape. At smaller flower quantities, dynamics were clearly linear, where incremental increases in number of flowers showed significant increases in bee abundance and species density. At larger quantities of floral additions, however, dynamics were nonlinear in that incremental increases in flower quantity had no effect on bee abundance and highly variable effects on bee species density.

To test the effectiveness of small-scale floral additions on enhancing urban bee populations, as well as their impact from 1 year to the next, different quantities of potted sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima) flowers were placed across sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan for two consecutive years and the resulting Halictid bee visitors were monitored. Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee abundance and species density in an urban landscape.

Despite societal dependence on pollinators for crop production, humankind continues to drive pollinator declines through agricultural intensification and urbanisation.
Urban environments can provide refuge to some pollinators. There is a need, however, to understand how pollinator communities can be supported in these areas while also considering human needs. Public green spaces provide a promising avenue to target plantpollinator conservation measures in an urban setting due to their large area, high abundance and low plantpollinator biodiversity.
We used a paired design to compare the plant community, pollinator community and plantpollinator interactions of (i) public urban green spaces enhanced with wildflower meadows and pollinator-friendly ornamental plantings to (ii) control unenhanced urban green spaces. The planting types within enhanced sites were also separately compared.
Our results show that not only was the diversity of the overall pollinator community higher in enhanced than control sites, but also the complexity of some wild Hymenoptera and the abundance of Diptera pollinator groups. The negative impact of urbanisation on some pollinator groups was reduced in enhanced sites compared with control sites. Planting both pollinator-friendly ornamental plants and wildflower meadows significantly increased the visits from Diptera and the diversity in the plantpollinator community compared with wildflower plantings alone.
Our results suggest that enhancing public spaces for pollinators has positive effects on key groups and can help mitigate the impacts of urbanisation.

A case study from uk cider apple orchards","10.1016/j.agee.2017.01.005","Flower strips are widely recommended as a tool to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependeht crops. Using UK cider apple orchards (Mains domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0-200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (<100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity in apple orchards.

Opportunities to restore habitat for bumblebees on uncropped arable field margins are now available, although the methods by which this restoration can be achieved have not been fully investigated. We present the results of a three year study undertaken to investigate the response of foraging bumblebees to five different arable field margin treatments (sown and unsown), as part of a replicated field experiment on arable farmland in northern England (UK). Bumblebee abundance was closely linked to successional changes in availability of suitable forage plant species. Field margin treatments sown with a `grass and wildflower' mixture had the highest bumblebee abundance, and provided a consistent supply of forage species, with different components of the seed mixture flowering in each year.

Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted.

Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California.

We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California.

To diversify pollination strategies, growers are turning to alternatives. Densely planted reservoirs of pollen- and nectar-rich flowers (pollination reservoirs, hereafter ""PRs"") may improve pollination services provided by wild bees. Our focal agroecosystem, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), exists in a simple landscape uniquely positioned to benefit from PRs. First, we contrast bee visitation rates and use of three types of PR. We consider the effects of PRs on wild bee diversity and the composition of bumble bee pollen loads. We contrast field-level crop pollination services between PRs and controls four years postestablishment. Last, we calculate the time to pay for PR investment. Social bees preferentially used clover plantings; solitary bees preferentially used wildflower plantings. On average, bumble bee pollen loads in treatment fields contained 37% PR pollen. PRs significantly increased visitation rates to the crop in year 4, and exerted a marginally significant positive influence on fruit set. The annualized costs of PRs were covered by the fourth year using the measured increase in pollination services. Our findings provide evidence of the positive impact of PRs on crop pollination services.","bees","wild bees","Apoidea","Superfamily","adults","pollinators","other","Three 1_m_ quadrats per treatment were observed on each sampling date, for a total of 9 minutes per treatment.","Green_habitat","Increase_flowers","Wildflower strips","The planted area at each treatment site included three 3.3- by 50.0-m treatments: natural regeneration, clovers, and wildflower.","green - low diversity","other crop","All PR treatment sites (n_=_3) were paired with a control (n_=_3), which consisted of a nearby (1.520_km), similarly managed lowbush blueberry field without PR treatments.","managed lowbush blueberry field","abundance","capture/visitation rate","individuals/_/min","mean","standard error",1.022689505,0.17894156,NA,NA,3,"3",1,"min",0.349528398,0.068168213,NA,NA,3,"3",1,"min",NA,"Figure 3","431.25","Mean value (n = 4 plots)","small (2)","38",NA,"needs some modification","estimated","After-Control-Impact (3)","experimental","peer-reviewed","Maine","United States","continental (D)",NA,NA,"other","rural",NA,"moderate (2)",0.3,0.144,1.022689505,0.349528398,1.07360639411599,0.0228837983525948

Implications for insect conservation Domestic gardens and allotments provide huge potential habitat for pollinators, and small-scale floral enhancements can attract more beneficial insects in fragmented urban landscapes, supporting urban biodiversity, pollination services and biological control.","bees","bumblebees","Bombus","Genus","adults","pollinators","trapping","Yellow sticky insect traps (Gardening Naturally, UK) were co-located with pan traps, attached to a bamboo cane elevated _ metre in situ for 2 weeks, then labelled and covered in clingfilm.","Green_habitat","Increase_flowers","Wildflower areas","Mix 2 (Table 1) was formulated based on existing literature and personal communications with Brown, R, and Wood, T.J, identifying flowers to attract a range of pollinator species and providing flowering cover across the season.","other","other","Control group participants were instructed to place a single set of pan traps in their site, away from existing garden flowers.","Not clarified (likely bare earth or lawn)","abundance","capture/visitation rate","individuals/trap","mean","standard error",0.3,0.18,NA,NA,15,"15",14,"trap-days",0.16,0.17,NA,NA,15,"15",14,"trap-days",NA,"Table 4","4","Individual plot(2m__2m)","small (2)","5",NA,"directly applicable","raw","Randomised control trial (2)","experimental","peer-reviewed","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","temperate (C)",NA,NA,"in UK","urban",NA,"easy (1)",0.3,0.144,0.3,0.16,0.628608659422374,0.0992604166666667

To analyze local and landscape-scale effects of enhanced urban roadsides on wild bee communities and to identify bee traits affected by urban filtering, we established 78 wildflower patches with a native seed mixture along five major roads in Munich (S Germany). Species-poor roadsides with regular management were used as control. During a three-year experiment, we sampled wild bees with pan traps, monitored roadside vegetation, and analyzed landscape diversity and perimeter-area ratio of green space within a radius of 500 m. We gathered information on wild bee morphological, behavioral, phenological, and foraging traits and calculated their abundance, species richness and functional dispersion. Wild bee abundance, richness and functional dispersion increased with vegetation diversity. Functional dispersion was positively correlated with landscape diversity and distance from the city center, indicating trait-based urban filtering. A fourth corner analysis revealed that small, short-lived, and univoltine bees were disadvantaged at urban roadsides. While univoltine bees were discriminated in areas of high landscape diversity, large bees prevailed in the city outskirts, and solitary bees were associated with green space edges.
